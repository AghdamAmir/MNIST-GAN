# MNIST-GAN

The notebook contains a step-by-step construction of the major components of a GAN from scratch along with the training phase.
It also includes elucidated explanations on how each component has been implemented and is helpful to get started with GANs and get a handle on them.

The following image demonstrates the progressive improvement of the generator in generating real handwritten digits during different phases of training:

In this basic model, Generator and Discriminator are linear models.
